MNIST Digit Recognition using CNN

This project is a complete deep learning project that focuses on recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is automatically downloaded through Keras, so no manual dataset download or preparation is required. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the full process of building, training, evaluating, and using a deep learning model for image classification in a clear and structured way.

The project begins by loading the MNIST dataset and visualizing sample images to understand the nature of the data. Each image is preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to the range of 0 to 1, reshaping the images to include a channel dimension, and converting the labels into one-hot encoded format suitable for classification tasks. The CNN model is then constructed using convolutional layers to extract important features, max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, a flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, and dense layers to learn complex relationships and perform the final classification. The output layer uses softmax activation to provide probability distributions across the 10 digit classes.

After building the model, it is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function. The model is trained on the training data with a validation split to monitor performance on unseen data during training. The training process involves multiple epochs, during which the model iteratively improves its weights to minimize the loss function. After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to measure its accuracy and loss, providing an objective assessment of its performance. The model typically achieves around 98% test accuracy, demonstrating strong performance for handwritten digit recognition. Predictions are then made on individual test images, and the results are visualized to show the actual versus predicted labels, providing a clear demonstration of the model’s capabilities.

The trained CNN model is saved as mnist_cnn_model.h5, which allows it to be loaded and used later without retraining. This makes the project practical for deployment or integration into other applications. The project uses Python as the main programming language, TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the deep learning model, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for visualization of images and results. This project is structured to serve as a foundation for more advanced computer vision projects, demonstrating best practices in preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and saving models for reuse. It is suitable for beginners to intermediate learners who want to understand the workflow of a deep learning project from start to finish, and it can easily be expanded with more complex architectures, additional datasets, or deployment pipelines.
